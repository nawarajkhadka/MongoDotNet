#Weather Forecast API with MongoDB in .NET

This repository contains a basic weather forecast API built using MongoDB and .NET. The primary focus is to utilize the BaseRepository for performing various CRUD operations, along with text search functionality in MongoDB.

The API is ready to run for testing, but note that the Dockerfile is not updated. Feel free to reuse the BaseRepository as required.
